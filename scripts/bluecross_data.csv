"HOW WE LEAD
We’re proud to develop innovative, helpful services, benefits and plans aimed at easing the burden of rising health care costs and improving the quality of care for every member.
More than 80% of Massachusetts doctors and hospitals take part in our Alternative Quality Contract, which rewards clinicians and hospitals for delivering high-quality, high-value patient care. Our model has served as a blueprint across the country for health plans serving millions of Americans.
We work directly with our members and health care providers to promote health and wellbeing -- from advocates who help members navigate mental health care, to nurses who call our most vulnerable members to help coordinate care and avoid unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital admissions.
We are the first health plan in our state to reward clinicians for addressing inequities in the quality of care across racial and ethnic groups.

"HOW WE GIVE BACK
We are proud to be among the top 10 corporate charitable donors in Massachusetts, investing $8.8 million in more than 450 not-for-profits to help Massachusetts residents live healthy lives in 2023.
In addition, 88% of our employees contributed more than 22,338 hours and $1.95 million in volunteer and pro bono support in 2023. Our company is also committed to doing business in a responsible, environmentally sustainable way. We have pledged to be carbon neutral and produce zero waste by 2030.
The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation, a private nonprofit grantmaking and research organization, also provides funding to Massachusetts not-for-profits. Over the past 22 years, it has awarded grants totaling more than $84 million to support hundreds of community-based programs and projects that ensure equitable access to health care for all those in the Commonwealth who are economically, racially, culturally or socially marginalized.
